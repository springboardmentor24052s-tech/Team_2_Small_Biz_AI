Churn prediction module.

BUG FIX in this version -- "12 days inactive showing as high risk":
CSV/manual sales create one `Sale` row per product line, not one per
checkout. A customer buying 3 products in one visit produces 3 Sale rows
on the same date. The previous version computed each customer's "normal
gap between purchases" directly from consecutive Sale rows -- so a
completely normal shopper with multi-item visits got an artificial
near-zero expected gap (since same-day rows have a 0-day gap between
them), which made even a totally ordinary 12-day absence look like
"massively overdue" relative to that fake near-0 cadence.
FIX: same-day sales for the same customer are now collapsed into one
"visit" before any cadence/gap math runs, so frequency and gaps reflect
actual shopping visits, not raw line items.

Why this avoids the older "same probability for whole groups of
customers" bug:
RandomForestClassifier's probability is "fraction of N trees that voted
churn" -- with few, redundant features, many different customers land in
the same tree leaf and get identical vote fractions. Logistic Regression's
probability is a smooth, continuous function of standardized features, so
two customers with different values mathematically cannot collide.

Design notes:
1. "Now" is anchored to the most recent sale date in the data, not
   wall-clock time.
2. The churn label is adaptive per customer (overdue relative to THEIR OWN
   normal visit cadence), not one fixed day-count for everyone.
3. Recommendations are generated from each customer's own combination of
   signals (value tier, spend trend, visit regularity, one-time vs
   repeat) so different customers get genuinely different text, not one
   of three templates.
4. Class-balanced, cross-validated (StratifiedKFold), so both the
   probabilities and the reported accuracy/precision/recall/F1 are
   trustworthy rather than a single lucky/unlucky split.
5. Real fallback for small datasets: a continuous heuristic score from
   each customer's overdue ratio, never a flat number for everyone.
